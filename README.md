### Reagent-Database
A quick script created using Python and PostgreSQL via the psycopg2 library. This script takes in csv files that contain all information for each order that is processed for my current job as a stem cell researcher. This was created so that we have a database to store this information for future reference, as opposed to just raw files that are prone to accidental editing or loss.
