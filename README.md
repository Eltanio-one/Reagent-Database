### Reagent-Database
A quick script created using Python and PostgreSQL via the psycopg2 library. This script takes in csv files that contain all information for each order that is processed for my current job as a stem cell researcher. This was created so that we have a database to store this information for future reference, as opposed to just raw files that are prone to accidental editing or loss.

V3 Overhaul:
I have recently been studying data cleaning and other data science/analytics topics, and thus wanted to apply what I have learnt to the reagent database to ensure that all data is easily queried and consistent for when it is hosted in the near future and used by members of my current workforce.
